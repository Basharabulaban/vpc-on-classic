If you have problems or questions when using {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Virtual Private Cloud, you can get help by searching for information or by asking questions through a forum. You can also open an IBM Support case.

If you have technical questions about the IBM Virtual Private Cloud, post your question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=vpc+ibm-cloud){: external} and tag your question with "vpc" and "ibm-cloud".

For information about opening an IBM Support case, or about support levels and case severities, see [Contacting support](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-getting-customer-support).

When opening a case, if given a choice of technical category, select the component under the `VPC` (Virtual Private Cloud) category:

* `Compute` for technical issues with instances, profiles, images, or keys
* `Network` for technical issues with VPCs, subnets, floating IPs, network ACLs, security groups, load balancers, or VPNs
* `Block Storage` for technical issues with volumes or volume profiles
