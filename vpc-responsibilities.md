# Your responsibilities by using IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud

## Management responsibilities
{: #responsibilities}

IBM provides you with an enterprise cloud platform to deploy your workload. You choose how to set up, integrate, back up, and operate your workloads in the cloud.

### Cloud Infrastructure

IBM's responsibilities:
- Deploy a fully managed, highly available, secured, IBM-owned infrastructure.
- Fulfill requests for VPC infrastructure, such as VPCs, subnets, Virtual Server instances, block storage volumes, security groups, network ACLs, floating IPs, public gateways, VPNs, Load Balancers and SSH Keys across multiple availability zones (AZs) and multi-zone regions (MZRs).
- Provide the ability to bring your own CIDR block to a subnet.

Your responsibilities:
- Use the provided API, CLI, or UI console to provision compute and storage, and to adjust networking configurations to meet the needs of your workload.
- Make sure any self-provided CIDR blocks do not conflict with CIDR blocks used by resources external to your VPC that you intend to consume.
- Design and deploy your workload in a way that achieves high availability using our provided tools, such as multiple availability zones and load balancers. At a high level, deploy your workloads in different zones of the region, use at least two load balancers located in different zones, and either use DNS records to point to the load balancers, or ensure that your application can handle a list of IP addresses that it can connect to. More details can be found under [deploy isolated workloads across multiple locations and zones](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=solution-tutorials-vpc-multi-region).

### VPC Workloads

IBM's responsibilities:
- Provide a suite of tools to automate VPC workload creation, such as the [IBM Cloud Terraform](https://ibm-cloud.github.io/tf-ibm-docs/index.html){: external} Provider.
- Provide private network access to OS-based update repositories.

Your responsibilities:
- Maintain OS patches, version updates, and security updates.
- Set up your back up and recovery strategies for workload data.
- Monitor the health of your workload using either the built in Virtual Server monitoring in Device Details or IBM Monitoring with Grafana.

### Security-rich Environment

IBM's responsibilities:
- Maintain controls commensurate to current industry compliance standards.
- Enable security features, such as encrypted disks with BYOK using KeyProtect.
- Continuously monitor stock images to detect vulnerability and security compliance issues.
- Use IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) for authentication and authorization of VPC resources.
- Provide audit records of the VPC resource lifecycle using IBM Activity Tracker with LogDNA, and monitoring of those resources using IBM Monitoring with Grafana.

Your responsibilities:
- Use security groups and network ACLs to secure your virtual server instances, such as restricting what IP addresses can SSH into the instance.
- Choose how to connect your workload to the public internet, if applicable, either using a public gateway or floating IP.
- Maintain the lifecycle of any keys used within KeyProtect for disk encryption.
- Restrict user access to the appropriate resources and resource groups.
- Integrate IBM Activity Tracker and IBM Monitoring data into your auditing and monitoring processes

### App Orchestration

IBM's responsibilities:
- None

Your responsibilities:
- Use the provided tools and features to configure and deploy; set up permissions; integrate with other services; externally serve; monitor the health; save, back up, and restore data; and otherwise manage your highly available and resilient workloads.
- Design and deploy your workload in a way that achieves high availability using our provided tools, such as multiple availability zones, regions, and load balancers. At a high level, deploy your workloads in different zones of the region, use at least two load balancers located in different zones, and either use DNS records to point to the load balancers, or ensure that your application can handle a list of IP addresses that it can connect to. More details can be found under [deploy isolated workloads across multiple locations and zones](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=solution-tutorials-vpc-multi-region).
