# vpc-on-classic

This repo is starting out its life as a copy of the VPC Infrastructure repository. The need for this change is created by the decision to change the name of the VPC offering that is currently available in whitelisted, Early Acccess release to "VPC on Classic" so that the next generation product can use the name "VPC" going forward.
