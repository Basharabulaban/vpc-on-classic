# API error messages
{: #rias-error-messages}

When you receive an error message from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Virtual Private Cloud APIs, you can use the message ID to find more information about how to resolve the problem.
{:shortdesc}

## account_disabled
**Message**: The account requesting this resource is disabled.

Create a new account.

## account_missing
**Message**: The account in the token was empty or did not exist in the request.

Recreate a token with a valid account and try again.

## account_type_invalid
**Message**: You must have a Pay-As-You-Go account to provision a Virtual Private Cloud.

Your account must be on a Pay-As-You-Go plan to provision VPCs. Refer to [Upgrade Your Account](/docs/account?topic=account-accounts#upgrade-lite-account) for instructions on how to upgrade your account.

## acl_in_use
**Message**: The network ACL cannot be deleted because it is attached to resources.

The network ACL cannot be deleted because it is attached to a subnet or VPC.

To see if a subnet is using the network ACL, use the `GET /v1/subnets?version=2019-05-31&generation=1` API.  Equivalent CLI command: `ibmcloud is subnets`.  To update the network ACL used by a subnet use the `PATCH /v1/subnets/{subnet_id}?version=2019-05-31&generation=1  -d '{ "network_acl":{ "id": “{network_acl_id}” } }’` API or `ibmcloud is subnet-update` CLI.

To see if a VPC is using the network ACL, use the `GET /v1/vpcs?version=2019-05-31&generation=1` API.  Equivalent CLI command: `ibmcloud is vpcs`. It is not possible to update or delete the default network ACL used by a VPC. The default network ACL is deleted automatically when the VPC gets deleted.

## acl_rule_does_not_allow
**Message**: An ACL rule on the subnet does not allow this action.

A network ACL rule would block the necessary network connections that are needed to perform the desired action.

If you are trying to create an instance, ensure that your subnet's ACL rules allow connectivity to all addresses in `161.26.0.0/16` for tcp and udp on source/destination ports `53`, `1688`, `80`, `443`, and `8443`.

## address_prefix_conflict
**Message**: The address prefix with this CIDR is in use.

The CIDR for the requested address prefix conflicts with an existing address prefix.

To view the list of address prefixes for a VPC, use the `GET /vpcs/{vpc-id}/address_prefixes` API and check that the requested CIDR address is not in use by the `cidr` field of another address prefix.
Equivalent CLI command: `ibmcloud is vpc-address-prefix`

## address_prefix_in_use
**Message**: Cannot delete an address prefix in use.

One or more subnets are using the address prefix.  To determine which subnets are using the address prefix, use the `GET /v1/subnets?version=2019-05-31&generation=1` API command and  check the `ipv4_cidr_block` field.  Equivalent CLI command:  `ibmcloud is subnets` and check the `Subnet CIDR` column. You must delete all the subnets using the address prefix before the address prefix can be deleted.

## backend_service_unavailable
**Message**: The backend service is unavailable.

A backend cloud service that is used by VPC failed to respond. VPC uses multiple IBM Cloud services, such as:

- [Identity and Asset Management](/docs/iam?topic=iam-iamoverview) (IAM)
- [Global Catalog](https://{DomainName}/catalog){: external}
- Resource Controller
- Resource Manager

You can check [status](https://{DomainName}/status){: external} of IBM Cloud services and try again in a few minutes. If this problem persists, [contact support](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-getting-help-and-support).

## bad_field
**Message**: Correct instance UUID should be provided

One of the values provided in the request is incorrect. Check the `target` value in the error returned for clues as to which parameter was incorrect. In some cases, the UUID or volume in the request cannot be found. Provide a valid value and try again.

Refer to the [API documentation](https://{DomainName}/apidocs/vpc-on-classic){: external} for additional help. If this problem persists, [contact support](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-getting-help-and-support).

## bad_request
**Message**: The information given was invalid, malformed, or missing a required field.

The request was not what we expected. Use the [API documentation](https://{DomainName}/apidocs/vpc-on-classic){: external} to help you format the request.

If you are following the specification but still get the error, [contact support](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-getting-help-and-support).

## classic_access_vpc_conflict_duplicate_res
**Message**: Only one VPC with Classic Access can be created per region.

Only one VPC with Classic Access can be created per region. To list the VPC with Classic Access, run `ibmcloud is vpcs --classic-access`. The existing VPC with Classic Access must be deleted before another one with Classic Access can be created.

## classic_access_vpc_account_not_VRF_enabled
**Message**: Account must be VRF-enabled to create a classic access VPC.

The linked classic account is not VRF-enabled. A classic access VPC requires the linked classic account to be VRF-enabled. To enable your account for VRF, refer to [VRF on IBM Cloud](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-setting-up-access-to-your-classic-infrastructure-from-vpc#vrf-conversion).

Even though the import image file name has a **.qcow2** extension, the contents is not valid.

## cos_not_authorized
**Message**: You are not authorized to access the cloud object store resource.

This error occurs if a user tries to import an image from a cloud object store to which they do not have access. Use the [Granting access between services](/docs/iam?topic=iam-serviceauth){: external} to help you grant authorization from the image service to the cloud object store bucket.

## cos_not_found
**Message**: Cloud object storage resource not found.

The cloud object storage resource specified could not be found. Verify that the resource identification is correct.

## cos_region_mismatch
**Message**: Cloud object storage resource not found in the target region.

The cloud object storage bucket specified could not be found in the target region. Make sure the bucket exists in the target region.

## cos_scheme_uri_invalid
**Message**: The cloud object storage URI provided is not in the correct format.

This error occurs if the URI has an incorrect scheme. The URI should follow this format: `cos://<region>/<bucket>/<sourceFile>`

## default_address_prefix_not_found
**Message**: Default address prefix not found.

You may see this error message when the default address prefix is not found.

## duplicate_error
**Message**: The input provided already exists.

The resource specified already exists. Try using a different name for the resource you want to create. For example, when creating a new VPC, you can list existing VPCs by running `ibmcloud is vpcs`, and choose a name that is not shown.

## field_no_longer_supported
**Message**: The field is no longer supported and should not be supplied.

The field provided was once supported but is no longer supported in the version specified. Look at the `target` values to determine which field is no longer supported.

For details, refer to the [API documentation](https://{DomainName}/apidocs/vpc-on-classic){: external}.


## floating_ip_in_use
**Message**: The floating IP is in use.

This floating IP is associated with a virtual server instance or public gateway.

To see where the floating IP is used, use the `GET /v1/floating_ips/e6e4850d-123e-43a9-a224-ea10a287770e?version=2019-03-12` API and look at the "target" values. Equivalent CLI command: `ibmcloud is floating-ip FLOATINGIP_ID`.

## gateway_too_many
**Message**: Can only have one public gateway per zone in a VPC.

Only one public gateway per zone is allowed in a VPC but the one public gateway can be attached to multiple subnets in the zone. To find the public gateway for a zone, run the GET public_gateways API and look at the "vpc" and "zone" values. If using the CLI, you can run the `ibmcloud is public-gateways` command and see the "VPC" and "Zone" value.

Use the public gateway's ID to attach it to a subnet, see an example in our [API examples](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-creating-a-vpc-using-the-rest-apis#attach-public-gateway-to-the-subnet). If using the CLI, you can use the subnet update command to attach it to a public gateway, for example, `ibmcloud is subnet-update SUBNET_ID --public-gateway-id PUBLIC_GATEWAY_ID`.

There was a request to attach a floating IP address to a server’s network interface, but the network interface already has a floating IP attached to it.

To find the floating IP address currently attached to a network interface, run the API command `GET /v1/floating_ips?version=2019-05-31&generation=1` and look for the network interface ID in the `target.id` field.

If you are using the CLI, run the command `ibmcloud is floating-ips` and look at the `Target` value. Be aware that the CLI truncates the network interface ID at the first dash (“-“) character. For example, a server’s primary network interface with an ID of `abdfcb29-b3c5-4e4a-b7a0-cf0300154699` appears as `primary(abdfcb29-.)` in the CLI output.
