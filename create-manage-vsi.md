# Creating and managing virtual server instances
{: #creating-and-managing-virtual-server-instances}

After you've created your {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}}, you'll want to add some {{site.data.keyword.vsi_is_short}}. You can instantiate virtual server instances quickly by using instance profiles (combinations of vCPU and RAM) that match the workload of the instance that you're planning to create.

1. For more information about planning your deployment process for {{site.data.keyword.vsi_is_short}}, see [Planning for instances](/docs/vpc-on-classic-vsi?topic=vpc-on-classic-vsi-planning-for-instances).

2. To start creating {{site.data.keyword.vsi_is_short}}, see [Creating virtual server instances](/docs/vpc-on-classic-vsi?topic=vpc-on-classic-vsi-creating-virtual-servers).

When your instances are created, you can start [Managing virtual server instances](/docs/vpc-on-classic-vsi?topic=vpc-on-classic-vsi-managing-virtual-server-instances).
